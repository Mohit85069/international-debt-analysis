# international-debt-analysis
The project involves using My SQL to query the International Debt Statistics Dataset made available by the World Bank.

I used the SQl queries to answer the following questions:

What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

Then I used PowerBI where I impoerted the same dataset and used calculated columns and DAX formulas to create some Measures to design a interactive dashboard through which I was able to draw the following insights:

Recognize Which countries fall into the Green, Orange and Red categories of debt owed.
Recognize average amount of debt owed across indicators and which indicators are pre-dominant using a Conditional (Bar) formatted table.
Recognize the most common debt indicator and the highest amount of principal repayments.
Other viable conclusions
